Exception Handling

try-catch blocks


Checked exception
        - extends from Exception but not RuntimeException

        - handled or declared

finally block
        - always runs
        - commonly used for closing connections to databases:
        things could go wrong, no matter what happens we always want to close the database connection.

throws - keyword used to declare Throwable (Exception)
        - goes after the method signature before the {

throw - keyword used to throw a new Exception


Error - cannot get recovered by handling techniques
        - cause termination of the program abnormally
        - mostly occur at runtime

e.g. Out of memory error or a System crash error. Thrown to indicate the JVM is broken or out of resources.
